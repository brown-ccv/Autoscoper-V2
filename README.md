# Autoscoper-V2

This version of autoscoper was redesigned by Dr. Ben Knorlein. Autoscoper 1 was developed by Andy Loomis (original CUDA version) and Mark Howison (OpenCL reimplementation). Version 2 combines the sources of both the CUDA and OpenCL version and allows usage of either one. Furthermore in order to simplify installation and compilation the build system has been changed to CMake and the UI was switched to QT4. Version 2 also has improved processing, several bugfixes and new functionality, e.g. multibone support, batch processing, use of external software to compute matching of bones (e.g. Matlab), improved clipping and many more features when compared to the original versions. The newest version of autoscoper is currently modified and maintained by Bardiya Akhbari.

The source code and binaries can be downloaded from [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/xromm/autoscoper-v2/src/master/). 
Also please checkout [this branch](https://bitbucket.org/xromm/autoscoper-v2/src/BA_Playground/) which was created by Bardiya Akhbari with additional debugging and support for Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm.
