# Autoscoper-V2

This is autoscoper 2 by Dr. Ben Knorlein. Autoscoper 1 was developed by Andy Loomis (original CUDA version) and Mark Howison (OpenCL reimplementation). The new Version 2 combines the sources of both the CUDA and OpenCL version and allows usage of either one. Furthermore in order to simplify installation and compilation the build system has been changed to CMake and the UI was switched to QT4. In addition, Version 2 has improved processing, several bugfixes and new functionality, e.g. multibone, batch processing, when compared to the original versions.

The source code and binaries can be downloaded from [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/xromm/autoscoper-v2/src/master/) 
Also please checkout [this branch](https://bitbucket.org/xromm/autoscoper-v2/src/BA_Playground/) which was created by Bardiya Akhbari with additional debugging and implementing support for Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. An executable of the updated branch can be downloaded [here](https://simtk.org/projects/autoscoper)
